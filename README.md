<strong>The Odin Project - Foundations - JavaScript Basics - Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors</strong>

<p>The goal of this project is to build on and cement my JavaScript skills and knowledge that I have gained while working through The Odin Project.</p>
<p>I will be building a simple implementation of the classic "rock-paper-scissors" game from scratch using JavaScript.</p>
<p>The first iteration of this game will be played soley within the console. I will revisit this project later in the JavaScript Foundations to add a GUI using HTML and CSS.</p>

<strong>After completing this project, I have accomplished:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Continued improvement of version control using Git and GitHub</li>
    <li>Writing javascript functions using detailed, yet concise, names</li>
    <li>Testing and debugging code</li>
    <li>JavaScript coding and scripting best practices</li>
    <li>Problem solving</li>
    <li>Understanding the importance of commenting code</li>
</ul>
